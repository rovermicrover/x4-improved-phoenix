# About

The Phoenix looks good on paper but its large turrets are very poorly placed to almost be worthless, making the Phoenix very poor in combat in sector.

This mod seeks to make the Phoenix better in sector by

* Moving its two large turrets to the front.
* Buffing its missile capacity.

# What Is Modified?

* The Phoenix layout file
* The Phoenix ship macro files

# Notes

* Existing Phoenix will all loose their Large Turrets. Will need to be replaced because existing turrets cannot be moved, only removed.
